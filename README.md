The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División commonly known as La Liga is the top professional soccer division for men in the Spanish football league system. It consists of 20 teams; the bottom three teams are relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams as well as the play-off winner from the Segunda Division.  

Over the years, 62 teams have competed in La Liga, winning nine titles. Real Madrid has won the championship a record 34 times. La Liga has been the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and has led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country.  

The goal of the analysis is to find relevant insights on predicting the winning team and Betting returns. Feature Selection, Correlation of Different Factors, Fitting and enhancing the performance of Predictive Models will be executed while answering the business questions. 

* Predict the winning team (Home team or away team).  
From the preliminary analysis, we found that teams are more likely to win on their home ground. A predictive model to determine the winning team whilst including other factors can be built using logistic regression technique.

* What are the factors influencing the returns of betting companies?  
It is a general assumption that the returns from betting companies vary w.r.t the match statistics. Using multiple regression analysis, we can find the factors that influence the returns of betting companies. This method facilitates the analysis of relationships between single dependent variable (betting return rates) and multiple independent variables (match statistics such as goals, wins, red cards and yellow cards, etc.)

* Do all betting companies give the same returns?  
While placing bets it is confusing to choose a company that yields maximum results, hence differences in mean returns of companies is analyzed. ANOVA test can be used to statistically validate if all companies provide similar returns.
